# LayerNorm
Describe what geometric effect LayerNorm has on the activations. Describe how RMSNorm differs from LayerNorm. Measure the average norm of activation vectors after layer 6 in the residual stream of GPT-2 small (after subtracting mean activation), and how much it varies. Plot a histogram of norms over samples &amp; tokens.
